# Top-k-searching
Searching top-k from a large number of data by CUDA programming on NVIDIA GPU

Firstly,detecting human face from the input picture and extracting the feature vector of human face picture.Secondly,Searching the similar feature vector from human face feature vector database by calculating the Hamming distance and consine distance between input human face feature vector and database human face feature vector.
